# Simple Microinteractions

**User experience isn't about layout or a single widget on the screen. UX is about all of those things combined, how they flow together, and how your audience transitions from one to the other.**

In 2020, your user experience isn't complete if you're not including microinteractions throughout your product. Too often, UX designers feel that transitions, effects, animations, or hover effects aren't parrt of their domain. They leave the work for those who specialize in User Interface design or, in many cases, the development team building the project. 

Your users deserve better. 

How can you utilize a hidden side-menu if you don't know how it's going to interact with your page? Will your onboarding be useful if you haven't taken the time to define how your audience will get from the introduction, on through the profile set-up, to using the product for the first time?

Every member of a production team should be thinking about whole macro view of the product. Knocking out a 2-week sprint may produce a great single feature, but if you're not going back to cleanly define your microinteractions, then users will be left with a cold, lifeless product. 

When that happens, its not long before they jump ship to the competitor that they enjoy using.
